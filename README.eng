Neural DX Cluster is a next-gen DX monitoring application designed for serious ham radio operators. Unlike traditional clusters that simply display raw text lists, Neural DX uses a "Dual Spectrum" GUI to separate HF traffic (Shortwave) from VHF/UHF/Space traffic.

It analyzes spots in real-time, detects propagation openings (Surges), and ranks stations based on interest using an intelligent scoring algorithm.
✨ Key Features

    🖥️ Dual Spectrum Dashboard:
        HF Sector (160m - 10m): Global map, Top DX List, Ionospheric propagation charts.
        VHF Sector (6m - QO-100): Local/Regional map, Top Tropo/ES/EME List, Specific activity charts.
    🧠 AI Scoring Algorithm: The system scores every spot (0-100) based on prefix rarity, mode, band, and comments (e.g., "UP", "SPLIT").
    ⚠️ Surge Detection: Sliding statistical analysis to detect abnormal activity spikes on a band (e.g., sudden 10m or 6m opening).
    🎙️ Voice Alerts & Watchlist: Text-to-speech announcements for openings and priority monitoring for your favorite callsigns (friends, DXpeditions).
    🎨 Customizable Interface:
        Visual Themes: Cyber, Matrix, Amber, Neon.
        Dynamic Filters: By Band and Mode (CW, SSB, FT8, FT4, FM).
    🗺️ Live Mapping: Spots displayed on interactive maps (Leaflet).

🛠️ Installation

    Prerequisites: Python 3.x installed on your machine.
    Install dependencies:

pip install flask feedparser

Configuration:
Open webapp.py and change the MY_CALL variable to your callsign:

    MY_CALL = "YOUR_CALLSIGN"

🚀 Running the App

    Start the application:

    python webapp.py

    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    http://localhost:8000

The system will automatically download the country database (cty.dat), connect to Telnet clusters, and begin populating the maps.
📂 Project Structure

    webapp.py: The backend core (Flask, Telnet management, AI Logic).
    templates/index.html: The frontend interface (HTML5, CSS Grid, JS, Leaflet, Chart.js).
    cty.dat: Country prefix database (auto-downloaded).
    watchlist.json: Stores your tracked callsigns (auto-generated).
