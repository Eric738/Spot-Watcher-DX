📡 Radio Spot Watcher DX — v6.2

DX Cluster Dashboard & Advanced Radio Analysis Engine

Local DX monitoring and radio analysis web application designed for demanding amateur radio operators.
Built to observe, understand, and gain perspective — not to create visual noise.

🧭 Overview

Radio Spot Watcher DX is a local web application that:

connects to one or multiple DX Clusters (Telnet)

displays real-time spots (HF / VHF / UHF)

integrates solar indices (SFI, A, Kp…)

maintains a usable activity memory

provides multiple levels of interpretation, from live monitoring to strategic analysis

The goal is not to see more,
but to see clearly.

🖥️ Main Pages
1️⃣ Index Page — Real-Time Monitoring & Operator Tracking

Immediate observation interface.

It displays:

live spot stream

active bands

wanted DX

solar indices

activity surge signals

👉 Objective: understand what is happening now.

📡 WATCHLIST · Tracking Panel

Feature introduced to answer a simple need:

“I wasn’t in front of the screen — what did I miss?”

based on the watchlist

uses in-memory historical tracking

displays latest spots per callsign

Philosophy:

❌ not a raw log

❌ not a massive data dump

✅ a catch-up tool

✅ designed for the human operator

2️⃣ Map Page — Observation Map (Micro-Level View)

Classic view of individual spots:

each point = one station

immediate geographical representation

instant visibility

👉 Objective: see where activity is occurring.

The Map page is an execution tool.

3️⃣ Analysis Page — Deferred META Analysis

A deliberately non-real-time tool, based on application log analysis.

👉 A perspective tool, not a gadget.

4️⃣ World Page — Forecast & Anomalies

The World page is fundamentally different from the Map page.

Page	Nature	Core Question
Map	Raw observation	Who is active right now?
World	Interpreted analysis	Where is propagation unusually favorable?

displays zones, not stations

spatio-temporal clustering

noise filtering

controlled refresh

👉 World decides, Map executes.

5️⃣ DX Briefing

A “Briefing” page updated every 12 hours, summarizing essential DX information and now including:

the ability to automatically add selected callsigns (optional) to the watchlist on the Index page

ensuring you never miss an expedition

As soon as an expedition callsign is spotted, it appears highlighted in yellow.
