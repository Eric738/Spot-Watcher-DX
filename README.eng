# 🛰️ NEURAL DX v4.2 - Enhanced Design & Ergonomics 🚀

## 💡 Project Summary

**NEURAL DX v4.2** is a real-time amateur radio monitoring station. Built on Python/Flask (backend) and a dynamic web interface (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), this version combines the performance of previous versions with enhanced display flexibility and better ergonomics. It aggregates and analyzes DX spot data, visualizes them on live maps, calculates contact distances, and generates targeted propagation alerts.

## 🆕 New Features and Improvements in Version 4.2

This version focuses on improving the user experience and the dashboard's aesthetic.

* **Callsign Design (NEW) :**
    * Callsigns in the DX Spots tables are now displayed in a **"console badge"** style (using the `.callsign-badge` class) with the neon/accent color. This significantly enhances readability and aesthetic consistency with the "system" theme.
* **Dashboard Ergonomics :**
    * **Watchlist Input :** A direct input field has been added to the Watchlist panel for quick addition of callsigns.
    * **Distance Column (km) :** The `Dist (km)` column has been restored to both HF and VHF tables.
* **Data Visualization :**
    * **Cartography :** The background of the HF/VHF map panels is now a **dark/black background** for better contrast with propagation traces.
    * **Live Charts :** The "LIVE BAND ACTIVITY" charts (HF and VHF) are now correctly displayed as **Bar Charts (Bargraphs)**, which are more suitable for comparing real-time band activity than ring charts.
* **Drag & Drop Reordering :** The information panels in the side columns can be reordered by the user using drag-and-drop. This order is saved in the browser's local storage.
* **Dynamic Themes :** The `🔆` button now displays the active theme name and correctly toggles between available styles (`SOFTTECH`, `DARK`).

## 🖱️ Interface Usage

### 1. Customizing the Display

* **Themes :** Click the `🔆` button in the header to switch the appearance between **SoftTech** and **Dark Mode**.
* **Drag & Drop :** Click and hold the `⋮⋮` icon in the panel header (e.g., `LIVE BANDS`, `WATCHLIST`) to drag and drop it, changing its display order. The order is preserved upon reload.

### 2. Setting the QRA Locator

In the **QTH & CONFIG** panel:

1.  Enter your QRA Locator (e.g., `JN33`, `JN33BB`).
2.  Click **Update**.
3.  The system centers the maps on your location and updates all distance calculations.

### 3. Watchlist

* Enter a callsign (e.g., `K1TTT`) in the input field of the **WATCHLIST** panel and click **Add**.
* Spots for this callsign will be highlighted (yellow background).

### 4. Alert Systems

* **SURGE :** A flashing banner appears if the number of spots on a band exceeds the threshold defined in `webapp.py`.
