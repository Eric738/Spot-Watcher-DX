📡 DX Cluster Dashboard – v4.8 (Neural AI Edition)

Next-generation real-time web dashboard for radio amateurs, powered by a statistical analysis engine and connected to DX Clusters via Telnet.

Designed for proactive DX monitoring, advanced geographic visualization, and propagation optimization.

🚀 What’s new in v4.8?

Timestamping of spots on the Analysis page and in the “Anomaly Detector” panel

Regular automatic reset of detected anomalies

🚀 What’s new in v4.7?

This release introduces the “Neural AI” label, adding an intelligence and analysis layer on top of raw DX Cluster data.

🧠 SPD Scoring Engine (Spot Priority / Difficulty)

Assignment of a score from 0 to 100 for each spot, based on:

Prefix rarity

Operating mode (CW bonus)

Distance

Spot comments (Split, UP, DX)

Immediate identification of “Wanted” stations (Score > 70)

🗺️ AI Path Optimizer & Grayline

Path visualization: calculation and display of the optimal path vs. long path for each spot

Propagation analysis: Grayline-based recommendations to avoid ionospheric absorption

📊 24h DXCC Statistics & Rarity

New analytical dashboard including:

Number of unique DXCC entities worked/seen in the last 24 hours

Global rarity rate (Rarity Rate %)

Dynamic list of long-distance calls (> 10,000 km)

🌠 Meteor Scatter (MS) Monitoring

Integration of meteor shower calendars (Perseids, Leonids, etc.)

Automatic detection of MSK144 activity on 2m, with dedicated Surge alerts

🛠️ Historical Features

Correction of the DXCC country list according to the Most Wanted List

🔗 Cluster Connectivity

Persistent multi-source Telnet connections (dxfun.com, cluster.dx.de, etc.) with automatic reconnection

Manual spot submission directly from the interface

☀️ NOAA Solar Data

Real-time retrieval of SFI, A, and K indices from NOAA servers

Solar data export via API in XML and JSON formats

🗣️ Voice Synthesis & Alerts

Multilingual voice announcements (FR, EN, ES, HE) for new spots

Custom Watchlist management with visual notifications

📊 Modular Interface

Column-based dashboard with drag & drop panels

12-hour activity histograms by band

🧠 Technical Architecture

Backend: Python 3.x / Flask

Processing: Multithreading (dedicated workers for Telnet, Solar, RSS, and Statistics)

Frontend: HTML5 / Vanilla JavaScript / Leaflet (mapping)

Databases: Geolocation via cty.dat (auto-updated) and watchlist.json

New API Routes (v4.7)

/dxcc_stats_24h.json – Daily analytical data

/ai_path_data.json – Coordinates for the path optimizer

/api/solar.xml – XML feed of solar data for third-party integration
